🧹 SweepTabs Privacy Policy

Effective Date: October 2, 2025

SweepTabs is a Chrome extension built to help users declutter their browsers by automatically identifying and closing unused tabs.
We value your privacy and are fully committed to keeping your data safe and secure.

🔒 Data Collection
SweepTabs does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information.
All features operate locally within your browser, without external servers or data tracking.

No names, emails, passwords, browsing history, or financial information are accessed, stored, or shared — ever.

⚙️ Permissions Used
SweepTabs requests only the permissions required to perform its core functionality:
tabs — to read and manage open tabs
storage — to save preferences locally
idle – Detect user inactivity for smart cleanup
notifications – Notify when tabs are auto-cleaned

All permissions are used locally and never transmit data externally.

🌐 Remote Code
SweepTabs loads a lightweight JavaScript library from a trusted CDN to enhance performance and reduce extension size.
This code is static, versioned, and limited to UI rendering — it does not access, collect, or send any user data.

🚀 Future Features
In future updates, SweepTabs may introduce optional premium features, such as login or cloud synchronization.
These will always be opt-in, clearly disclosed, and require explicit user consent before any new permissions or data access occur.
The privacy policy will be updated accordingly.

🤝 Data Sharing
SweepTabs does not sell, share, or transfer user data to any third parties.
We do not use or analyze user information for advertising, analytics, or profiling.
SweepTabs operates under a strict privacy-first model.

We are dedicated to providing a safe, transparent, and privacy-respecting browsing experience for every user.
