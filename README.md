# SweepTabs Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 2, 2025

SweepTabs is a Chrome extension designed to help users declutter their browser by identifying and closing unused tabs. We are committed to protecting user privacy and ensuring transparency in how our extension operates.

## Data Collection

SweepTabs does **not collect**, store, or transmit any personal data. All functionality runs locally within the user's browser. No names, emails, passwords, or financial information are accessed or stored.

## Permissions Used

- **tabs**: To read open tabs and identify inactive or duplicate ones.
- **storage**: To save user preferences such as cleanup frequency and excluded domains.
- **idle**: To detect when the user is inactive, so cleanup runs only when appropriate.
- **notifications**: To inform users when tabs have been cleaned or actions taken.

These permissions are used solely to provide the core functionality of SweepTabs. No data is shared externally.

## Remote Code

SweepTabs loads a lightweight JavaScript library from a trusted CDN (e.g. jsDelivr or unpkg) to improve performance and reduce extension size. This code is static, versioned, and does not collect or transmit any user data.

## Future Features

In future updates, SweepTabs may offer optional premium features such as login or cloud sync. Any such features will be clearly disclosed and require user consent. We will update this policy accordingly.

## Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, share, or transfer user data to third parties. We do **not** use data for advertising, credit scoring, or unrelated purposes.
